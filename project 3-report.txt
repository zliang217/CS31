Part I: Obstacles encountered
With the introduction of function, the logic involved in the program becomes much more complicated. Multiple compounded if statements and for loops make me scratch my head, and many times a wrong placement of a statement causes an infinite loop. Also, how to properly design a function to reduce repetition of code is also not that easy. I am a math undergraduate and I find the process of doing a project much like proving a big theorem: you break the whole thing into small chunks that build up the solution.

Part II: Cases Tested
Case 0: song="" (empty string)
Case 1: song="qq" (Incorrect Syntax, 'q' is not a valid color)
Case 2: song="gg" (Incorrect Syntax, "gg" doesn't form a complete beat which ends with '/')
Case 3: song="g999/" (Incorrect Syntax, 3 digits, which is not allowed)
Case 4: song="o/r3//y/" (Correct Syntax but not translatable, abrupt beat appears when sustained note is in effect)
Case 5: song="o//y/r3//" (Correct Syntax but not translatable, ends prematurely)
Case 6: song="g1/" (Correct Syntax but not translatable, sustained note of length 0 or 1)
Case 7: song="r//g3///y10//////////o/" (Translatable)

Part III: Pseudocode
bool hasCorrectSyntax (string song){
	if song is empty, return true;
	else if the first char is neither '/' nor a color, return false;
	repeatedly (from 1 to the second last digit):
		if the char is '/', true and move to the next char;
		else if the char is color,
			if the next char is neither ‘/‘ nor a digit, return false;
			else true and move to the next char;
		else if the char is a digit, 
			if the next char is ‘/‘, true and move to the next char;
			else if the next char is also a digit, is not followed by a digit, and is not out of bound, true and move to the next char;
			else return false;
		else (the char is not ‘/‘, not color, and not digit), return false;
	manually check if the last char is not a '/', return false;
	return true if it gets to this line;
}

int translateSong (string song, string& instructions, int& badBeat){
	if the song is translatable, set instruction to translation(song);//a function I wrote myself
	if the song doesn’t have correct syntax, return 1;
	if the two cases above are not got to,
		repeatedly:
			if the char is a digit, 
				if the next char is also a digit, get the corresponding value of the two chars;
					if the value < 2, badBeat is set to the number of this beat, and return 2;
					else if the number of characters after the digit > the value of the digit, repeatedly:
						if any char is not ‘/‘ when sustained note is in effect, set badBeat to this beat, and return 3;
					else if the number of characters after the digit < the value of the digit, set badBeat to number of beats in this song plus one (end prematurely) and return 4;		
				else, get the corresponding value of this digit;
					if the value < 2, badBeat is set to the number of this beat, and return 2;
					else if the number of characters after the digit > the value of the digit, repeatedly:
						if any char is not ‘/‘ when sustained note is in effect, set badBeat to this beat, and return 3;
					else if the number of characters after the digit < the value of the digit, set badBeat to number of beats in this song plus one (end prematurely) and return 4;
}

string translation (string song){
declare string newSong;
if song is empty, return song itself (which is empty);
else, repeatedly:
	if the char is color, 
		if the char after it is a digit and followed by a digit, get the corresponding value of the two chars;
			repeatedly: 
				add the uppercase of the color char the value of two char times to newSong;
				move to the char after these sustained notes;
		if the char after it is a digit but is not followed by a digit, get the corresponding value of this one char;
			repeatedly: 
				add the uppercase of the color char the value of two char times to newSong;
				move to the char after these sustained notes;
		else, add the lowercase of the color char to newSong, and move to the next beat;
	if the char is ‘/‘, add ‘x’ to newSong, and move to the next beat; 
return newSong;
}
