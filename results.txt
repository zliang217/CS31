It always does seem to
me that I am doing more
work than I should do.
It is not that I object
to the work, mind you; I
like work: it fascinates
me. I can sit and look
at it for hours.  I love
to keep it by me: the
idea of getting rid of
it nearly breaks my
heart.

You cannot give me too
much work; to accumulate
work has almost become a
passion with me: my
study is so full of it
now, that there is
hardly an inch of room
for any more.
